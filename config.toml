Of the nearly 30 million infected annually, many have no symptoms and either recover or develop silent chronic liver disease; however, some develop acute illness with fatigue, poor appetite and jaundice (yellow eyes and skin). Approximately 5% of those with acute HBV develop chronic infection (over 250 million currently infected worldwide), leading to scarring of the liver and later liver cancer, if not treated. The common means of transmission in many parts of the world is from an HBV-infected mother to her child. With current treatment, only 5 - 10% of those chronically infected can be cured, meaning that most patients require lifelong treatment to control their infection. At Antios, we are committed to curing this global health epidemic."
