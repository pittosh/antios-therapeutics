ATLANTA, Sept. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Antios Therapeutics, Inc. ("Antios"), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of innovative therapies to treat and cure viral diseases, today announced a digitally available oral presentation at the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Digital International Liver Congress&#8482; 2020.

The title of the abstract (SAT-422) presented is as follows:

"ATI-2173, A Novel Phosphoramidate Nucleoside Prodrug for HBV Cure Regimens"

The presentation will be available digitally to EASL's registered participants until December 31, 2020 and includes data demonstrating significant liver-targeting in animal studies and potent in-vitro anti-HBV activity of ATI-2173.

## About ATI-2173

ATI-2173 is a novel liver-targeted molecule designed to deliver the 5'-monophosphate of clevudine. This L-nucleoside's active 5'-triphosphate has unique antiviral properties as a non-competitive, non-chain terminating HBV polymerase inhibitor. By selectively delivering the 5'-monophosphate to the liver, while retaining the unique anti-HBV activity of the active 5'- triphosphate, ATI-2173 could become an integral part of a curative combination regimen for chronic hepatitis B.
