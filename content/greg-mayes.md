Mr. Mayes is the Chief Executive Officer and a board member of Antios Therapeutics. Prior to Antios and drawing on inspiration from his son's epilepsy diagnosis, he raised $40 million from prominent investors and founded the clinical-stage pharmaceutical company, Engage Therapeutics, to develop a product candidate for seizures. Upon approval, Staccato&reg; Alprazolam will be the first and only drug-device-combination for the rapid termination of an active epileptic seizure. Engage was sold to UCB in 2020 in a deal valued at $270 million following the successful completion of its randomized, phase 2b clinical study.

Prior to Engage, Mr. Mayes played an integral role in the growth of Advaxis Immunotherapies (NASDAQ: ADXS), a biotech company developing immuno-oncology therapies for patients with hard-to-treat cancers through its bacterial vector system, Lm Technology&trade;. As its Chief Operating Officer, he was instrumental in helping to secure in excess of $200 million in follow-on funding and developing partnerships with companies such as Amgen, AstraZeneca and Merck & Co.

From 2004 to 2010, Mr. Mayes served as Vice President, General Counsel, and Chief Compliance Officer at ImClone Systems Corporation. During his tenure at ImClone, Mr. Mayes supported the clinical development and commercialization of ERBITUX&reg; and contributed significantly to activities that resulted in its acquisition by Eli Lilly for $6.5 billion in 2008.

Mr. Mayes is a cum laude graduate of Syracuse University where he was recognized as a Remembrance Scholar and he earned his J.D. degree magna cum laude from the Temple University School of Law where he was the Articles Editor on the Temple Law Review.
